# Intro

Hey, I'm Shakib. I recently graduated from Arizona State with my Master's degree in Computer Science. As of right now, I am looking for a new job after taking a break post-graduation. I used to be a data science intern at [Charles](https://schwab.com) [Schwab](https://schwab.com). There, I had a lot of data engineering tasks and then had some freedom to work on some data science projects. Prior to that, I worked at a security company called [Privoro](https://privoro.com/). Check out the resume tab for more infomation about these roles! In my free time, I love playing and watching basketball, reading, and working on coding projects with my younger brother.

# Some history

- As a kid, I spent a lot of my time reading and playing sports.

- My first experience with a computer was playing games on miniclip and poptropica on my family computer.

- Around the age of 13, I started to play a lot of video games, which drastically hurt how often I played sports.

- When I started high school, I was dead set on working on something heavily math related because it was my favorite subject in school. 

- During high school, I picked up playing Tennis because I thought it would be easy. When I tried out for my high school team, I found out that in fact, it was not easy. Though I made the team, I was not very good. 

- During high school, specifically my senior year, my family moved an hour away from school. Rather than transfer schools, I decided to make a long drive every day. However, at times, I would have days start at 4 am and end around 11 pm resulting in those drives being miserable. But we power on. 

- After having graduating high school, I applied to a couple schools. However, I ended up choosing ASU because I did not want to take on too much debt and I wanted to be close to home. 

- I started college as an electrical engineering major. 

- My best friend in college convinced me to do a hackathon with him. I was not very excited because I had never written any code prior, but he convinced me. We ended up winning the event and I found that I was far more passionate about computer science that I was about electrical engineering. 

- After having swapped, I landed my first internship when I was 20. 

- The next year, I took on a new opportunity because I wanted some experience in Data Science. 

- I spent the last year or so travelling and relaxing because I felt as though I was working very hard in school over the past 6 years. This website is a result of me wanting to practice some old skills!
